    <PackageReleaseNotes>Added support for Zipkin's built-in Kafka span reporting capabilities, for users who are already considering operating at that kind of large scale.
You can access the Kafka reporter via the following syntax:
```
var tracer = new ZipkinTracer(new ZipkinTracerOptions(new Endpoint("AaronsAppKafka"),
ZipkinKafkaSpanReporter.Create(new ZipkinKafkaReportingOptions(new[] {"localhost:19092"},
debugLogging: true))));
```
The `ZipkinKafkaSpanReporter.Create` method will give you the ability to specify the Kafka endpoint, topic, and batching settings used by Petabridge.Tracing.Zipkin for reporting spans back to Zipkin via a Kafka topic. Normally, however, all you'll need to specify is just a set of endpoints for Kafka brokers - both Zipkin and the Petabridge.Tracing.Zipkin client use the "zipkin" topic by default.
