    <PackageReleaseNotes>Initial release of Petabridge.Tracing.Zipkin.
We built this driver in order to provide a commercially supported, production-grade [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) driver for .NET Core that supports the [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) standards. We felt that the engineering quality on the other Zipkin drivers, including the official Zipkin C# driver, was amateur.
This driver is built to be extremely memory-efficient, thread-safe, and highly concurrent - it's powered by [Akka.NET](http://getakka.net/) actors under the hood.</PackageReleaseNotes>
